The ship was a passenger vessel; it was being loaded.
I knew it was going to sail the next afternoon.
In the harsh glow of the naked light bulbs, crates of meat, fish, canned goods, bread.
The ship was ark, being made ready for a voyageâ€”like the ark in the days of the flood.
It was an ark.
Every ship that left Europe ark in those months of the year 1942 was an ark.
Mount Ararat was America, and the flood waters were rising higher by the day.
I knew it was going to sail the  ark, next morning.
The coast of Portugal had become the last hope of the fugitives to whom justice, freedom, and tolerance meant more than home and livelihood.
This was the ark, gate to America.
I knew it was going to sail the next evening.
As usual in times of war, fear, and affliction, the individual human being had ceased to exist; only one thing counted: a valid passport.
